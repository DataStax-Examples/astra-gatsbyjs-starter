## Objectives
* Provide a fullstack development example using GraphQL with Astra as the storage backend.

## How this works
Once the Astra credentials are provided, the necessary tables are created in the database. The webservice will be available on port 8080 once the application has been deployed.

This example uses Typescript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. It is is designed for development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator, with much of the functionality of a modern front-end framework. It brings together the best components of React, webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and other front-end tools. This is used to generate the application.

## Get Started
